## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

By making this project, I learned how to work with Figma design files, convert them into HTML and CSS, and set up my workflow, when building web pages.

### Continued development

In the next challenges, besides the HTML and CSS, I will use React and Vue.js to solve the challenges and put my focus on the mobile-first design approach.
